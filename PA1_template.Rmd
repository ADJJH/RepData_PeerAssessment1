## Loading and preprocessing the data
1. Load the data

```{r,echo=TRUE}
#setwd(dirname(parent.frame(2)$ofile))
df<-read.csv("activity//activity.csv",header=TRUE,  na.strings = "NA")
df$date<-as.Date(df$date,"%Y-%m-%d")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Calculate the total number of steps taken per day  

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
steps_per_day<-df[,-3]%>% group_by(date) %>% summarise_each(funs(mean(.,na.rm=TRUE)))
```

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day  

```{r}
hist(steps_per_day$steps)
```
